## BMI Calculator 2.0

A program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It will tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 they are underweight
- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
- Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# Example Input
```
weight = 85
``
```
height = 1.75
```
# Example Output
85 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) =  27.755102040816325
```
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
